Peristalsis refers to the process of transporting fluid or semisolid materials through a tube by a systematic deformation of the surface of the tube. One may imagine this process similar to squeezing toothpaste out of the tube by pinching and sliding the surface of the tube. It is the main mechanism that is responsible for transport of chewed food through the human digestive tract where the surface movement is obtained by means of muscle relaxation and contraction. Natural mechanisms and processes have been central in motivating the study of on-chip devices which aim to mimic the same functionality, for example: a kidney filtration process or digestive system, on a miniature device. In this aspect, peristalsis offers a convenient method of moving fluids through tubes without the need of an external pump, thereby allowing one to save space on miniaturized devices. Such processes are dependent strongly on the nature of the surface waves and hence are quite difficult to fine-tune. In a remarkable recent innovation from the Microfluidics Laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, researchers have envisaged to explore massive augmentation in peristaltic flow through on-chip control, by simply applying an external electric field. Professor Suman Chakraborty, leader of the Microfludics Laboratory and Head of the School of Medical Science and Technology, remarked that \"through our theoretical analysis, we�ve shown that by keeping the same peristalsis hardware, we may obtain an enhanced on-the-fly controllability of the flow rate by augmenting the device with electric fields.\" This research has been published in the prestigious journal Physics of Fluids, published by the American Institute of Physics, and has been coauthored by Prof. Chakraborty, his former Ph.D. student Aditya Bandopadhyay, who is presently a postdoctoral researcher in Geosciences Rennes (France), and by Dr. Dharmendra Tripathi, a faculty member at the Manipal University. According to Prof. Chakraborty, an electric field component can easily be implemented  in a peristaltic environment. When an electrical field is switched on, these electrodes cause fluid flow by attracting charged aqueous fluid, such as saline, toward the compatible electrode. From a pragmatic view, Bandopadhyay refers to electric fields as being the most efficient way of manipulating fluid flow and particulate motion through tubes at millimeter and micrometer ranges, without the involvement of any moving mechanical parts. Such an advantageous mechanism has, therefore, the potential to aid researchers in studying targeted drug delivery, augmenting biophysical fluid transport in human bodies, and observing and controlling chemical reaction and mixing in surface-modulated fluid flow environments, Prof. Chakraborty added.Future work for the Microfluidics laboratory includes analyzing the motion of charged particles in the electroosmotically-modulated peristaltic environment  a tricky matter, due to the interactions between hydrodynamic drag, fluid flow via the influence of the electric field, and particle motion due to presence of the electric field. The researchers are also working to develop nanoscale energy harvesting, microfluidics-based portable kits for rapid medical diagnostics, and microfluidic tools to deepen our understanding of the physiological dynamics of living systems."},{"Headlines":"IIT KGP Research suggests Indus Valley Civilization is 8000 years old","Description":"The rise of the post-Neolithic Bronze Age Harappan civilization 5700 - 3300 years before present, spread along the Indus Valley of Pakistan through the plains of NW India, including into the state of Gujarat and up to the Arabian Sea and its subsequent decline has remained an enigma in archaeological investigation. In the Indian subcontinent the major centers of this civilization include Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan and Lothal, Dholavira and Kalibangan in India. In recent years excavation at Rakhigarhi and few other places indicate that the civilization probably was more expansive than thought before. Whatever may be the extent most Harappan settlements grew in the floodplains of river systems including those of the Indus or now defunct Ghaggar-Hakra (mythical river Saraswati?). Many archaeologists believe that weakening of the summer monsoon after ‾5000 years and a major drought around 4200 years throughout the Asia probably were the reason behind the Harappan collapse.The recent research by a team of researchers from IIT Kharagpur, Institute of archaeology, Deccan college Pune, Physical research laboratory and Archaeological survey of India shows that the civilization itself was much older than thought before going back to 8th millennium before present and probably climate was not the only cause of Harappan collapse. The findings come from a major excavated site of Bhirrana, Haryana that shows preservation of all cultural levels of this ancient civilization from Pre-Harappan Hakra phase through Early Mature Harappan to mature Harappan time. While the earlier phases were represented by pastoral and early village farming communities, the mature Harappan settlements were highly urbanized with several organized cities, developed material and craft culture having trans-Asiatic trading to regions as distant as Arabia and Mesopotamia. The late Harappan phase witnessed large scale deurbanization, population decrease, abandonment of many established settlements, lack of basic amenities, interpersonal violence and disappearance of Harappan script. Bhirrana was part of a high concentration of settlements along the now dried up mythical Vedic river valley 'Saraswati', an extension of Ghaggar river in the Thar Desert. To find out how old the civilization is the researchers dated potteries of Early Mature Harappan time by a technique called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) which were found to be nearly 6000 years old, the oldest known pottery so far. The levels of Pre-Harappan Hakra phase have been dated to be as old as 8000 years.\"That the Bhirrana and probably several of the Indian Indus valley sites are much older than 5700 years has been guessed by many archaeologists for quite some time. Our study pushes back the antiquity to as old as 8th millennium before present and will have major implications to the evolution of human settlements in Indian sub-continent\" says Prof. Anindya Sarkar of Department of Geology and Geophysics, IIT Kharagpur and the lead investigator. The findings have been published in prestigious journal Nature Scientific report on 25th May.\"The Bhirrana site was excavated by late Dr. L.S. Rao in 2005-2006, also a co-author of the publication and yielded large quantities of animal remains like bones, teeth, horn cores of cow, goat, deer, antelope etc. and has been very useful to decipher the climatic condition in which this civilization flourished\" says Dr. Arati Deshpande Mukherjee, Assistant Professor in Deccan college Pune and a coinvestigator. \"We analysed the oxygen isotope composition in the bone and tooth phosphates of these 2 remains to unravel the climate pattern. The oxygen isotope in mammal bones and teeth preserve the signature of ancient meteoric water and in turn the intensity of monsoonal rainfall. Our study shows that that the pre-Harappan humans started inhabiting this area along the Ghaggar-Hakra rivers in a climate that was favourable for human settlement and agriculture. The monsoon was much stronger from 9000 years to 7000 years before present and probably fed these rivers making them mightier with vast floodplains\" said Prof. Sarkar. The study also reveals that the monsoon became progressively weaker from 7000 years onwards but surprisingly the civilization did not disappear, rather they continued to evolve even in the face of declining monsoon condition. \"It is very interesting to investigate how these ancient people coped with the then climate change and can be a lesson for today痴 impending disaster of climate change\" said Dr. Navin Juyal of Physical Research laboratory, Ahmedabad who dated the potteries and is a co-author of the paper. \"Our study suggests that the climate was probably not the cause of Harappan decline. Increasing evidences suggest that these people shifted their crop patterns from the large-grained cereals like wheat and barley during the early part of intensified monsoon to drought-resistant species of small millets and rice in the later part of declining monsoon and thereby changed their subsistence strategy. Because these later crops generally have much lower yield, the organized large storage system of mature Harappan period was abandoned giving rise to smaller more individual household based crop processing and storage system and could act as catalyst for the de-urbanisation of the Harappan civilization rather than an abrupt collapse\" said Prof. Sarkar. \"One thing is sure that these ancient people in India with no modern technology well managed the disastrous climate change and survived for several thousand years and suggests that we have lot to learn from them. We already have severe droughts and extreme climate events. It will be curious to know how long the modern human with all modern space, communication and agro-bio technology will survive the on-going global climate change\" he added."},{"Headlines":"Nandini Bhandaru, a PhD student conferred with European Materials Research Society's Young Scientist Award","Description":"Nandini Bhandaru, a PhD student at IIT Kharagpur has been recently conferred with European Materials Research Society�s Young Scientist Award at EMRS 2016 Spring Meeting Lille France. Nandini, who is working at Instability and Soft Patterning laboratory has won the award based on her outstanding contribution to material science and nano technology, particularly nano patterning of soft films and surfaces.Nandinis area of doctoral research is on nanofabrication including soft-Lithography, thin film dewetting, polymer blend films and self-assembly. Topographically patterned polymer films and surfaces find wide application in various areas such as organic electronics organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), optoelectronic devices, thin film transistors (TFTs), plastic solar cells, biological sensors microfluidics, smart and super adhesives, data storage media, lab-on-a-chip devices, surfaces for nano-biotechnology applications such as patterned substrates for probing of cell behavior, including stem cell scaffolds for tissue engineering, DNA stretching, and so on. For most of the above applications and many other bulk nano applications rapid prototyping of surfaces with the pattern extending over large areas (~cm2) is necessary. Many of these applications have revolutionized various aspects of our life, leaving their imprint in from engineering applications to biotechnological applications and health care. The innovation by Nandini, proposes the possibility of fabricating nano scale patterned surfaces, which may act as the mother board for many of the devices and applications listed above at an extremely low cost and using an inherently simple methodology.With this technique, the fabrication costs of these surfaces can be reduced to one tenth of the current Photolithography or Electron Beam Lithography based methods which requires high end expensive instrumentation.Part of the work has already been patented and published. One more paper and a patent are under preparation based on this work.The technique developed has been fully stabilized and patented and can be commercialized with minimal capital investment. In fact, we have already started collaborating with various groups across IIT KGP and other IITs for performing combinatorial experiments related to some of the themes discussed above. For example, we studied issues like how a living cell attaches or moves on a surface with differential feature height which is highly important in cancer therapeutics. The high aspect ratio patterns are also ideally suited for fabricating surfaces that exhibit structural superhydrophobicity said Nandini.Nandinis guide, Prof. Rabibrata Mukherjee from the Dept. of Chemical Engineering said, it had been one of my most satisfying experiences to mentor Nandini. She joined me young, as a fresh Masters student and ever since has been sky rocketing in research with outstanding contributions. After a very successful M Tech she decided to stay back with me for her PhD, declining several lucrative job offers. She has already made exception contribution in the field of nano patterning of thin films and surfaces. Very few researchers in the world have the capability of manipulating objects at the nanoscale, as she has. About the innovation he explains The key strength of this nanofabrication method is that it is very generic and robust in nature and hence can be demonstrtaed even in a high school laboratory. We have implemented it in various fields like solar energy harvesting, water purification membranes and as scaffolds in regenerative tissue engineering."},{"Headlines":"Google selects 15 IIT-Kharagpur students for coding programme","Description":"15 students from IIT KGP have been selected in one of the most prestigious open-source coding programs Google Summer of Code !

Repair of the 12th century shrine cannot be delayed any further. So, we are going to take an action to strengthen the columns to the maximum possible extent, to see that the beams do not collapse. These are two objectives in which the committee took the final decision on March 29. Prof. Gupta an expert in archaeology reviewed the condition of the Jagamohana in the presence of the superintendent of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), members of the SMTCC and members of the committee formed of  sevayats (temple servitors) to oversee the repair of Jagamohana. During the review, Gupta studied different reports on the issue prepared by the expert team and SMTCC earlier. In mid last year, the 20-member expert committee headed by Prof. Gupta, after a thorough inspection of the sanctum sanctorum and Jagamohan had suggested removal of moss from the Garbhagruha wall and roofs. The team had detected major cracks in the inner roof of Jagamohan and on the north east lintel and support pillar. They suggested ASI to carry out repairs for bringing structural stability to the Jagamohan. They also advised to stop burning of Diyas inside the Garbhagruha. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has fixed the damaged Kalahat and Jay Vijay, the two doors of Sri Jagannath temple and cleaned moss from the temple roofs and inner walls. The ASI has set temporary scaffolding under the Jagamohan roof which was severely damaged and was in a poor state.

These membranes filter the blood of uremic toxins. The clinical specifications of the membranes are 180-230 microns inner diameter and thickness of 35-50 microns. 7000-15,000 of such membranes are packed in a dialyzer cartridge. This yields an area of 1.1-1.5 m2 and also minimizes the dead volume of the cartridge to around 80-90 ml. Such a cartridge, once employed, takes around 3-3.5 hours to purify the total volume of blood in the human body. A person suffering from very severe kidney failure requires about 3 such sessions every week to stay healthy and thus 3 cartridges are required every week, one for each session. Focal point of the problem lies in manufacturing of these membranes. Worldwide, there are five to seven manufacturing houses that have the capability of manufacturing (called spinning) these membranes The technology employed by each of them is patented and broadly involves using a spinneret. These spinnerets are very expensive items (Rs. 18-30 lakhs) and moreover, are custom made and patented. This is the reason why dialysis membranes are not manufactured in India and hence all our cartridges are imported. The present innovation involves the development of a complete indigenous technology to spin such fibers. These fibers match the clinical specifications of Fresenius (German) company, a market leader, having an internal diameter of 220 microns and thickness of 35-40 microns. Fundamental flow behaviour and rheology of polymers in expensive spinnerets have been understood to mimic the spinneret design. This indigenous technology does not involve any expensive spinnerets, or imported equipment. Nor does this technology involve any sophisticated machinery. The invention uses disposable syringe assemblies (Rs 20), fabricated in the lab and a complete indigenous process design to spin dialysis grade fibers. This developed process does not involve any prime moving devices like pumps and utilizes minimum energy. All these factors, combined, make this technology ultra low cost and hence the fibers and cartridges are projected to cost around half of what is available in the market. The developed process has been filed for an Indian patent and is in process for a US patent. This technology, along with intelligent combination of already reported biocompatible polymer blends, has been utilized by the inventor to spin dialysis grade hollow fibers of various grades (high efficiency, high performance, high cut-off) which are available in the competitive market. The award will be presented by the Minister of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Ananth Kumar, Government of India in the presence of Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India, during a function to be organized at Bangalore on Saturday, 21 st February, 2015."},{"Headlines":"VGSOM student awarded 2nd runner up at Business Standard Best B-School Project Award","Description":"Final Year MBA student, Harshavardhan N, won the second runner-up award at the prestigious Business Standard Best B-School Project competition.

If not you, then who? If we are able to answer these fundamental questions, then perhaps we can wipe away the blot of human slavery.\"  Kailash Satyarthi, Winner of Nobel Peace Prize 2014.IIT Kharagpur had the privilege of hosting Sri Kailash Satyarthi at the campus in a TEDX event held on 19th January, 2013. The event was organized by Technology Transfer Group (TTG) students who work under the aegis of Sponsored Research & Industrial Consultancy (SRIC), IIT Kharagpur. The packed Kalidas auditorium listened to the journey undertaken by Sri Satyarthi with rapt attention. The 1000 strong audience included Director, Dean (SRIC), Associate Dean (SRIC), other faculty members and mostly the young student community.Sri Satyarthi in his talk gave some telling statistics. About 215 million children are found to be in modern day servitude i.e. child labour. 70 million children are not able to go to school. 150 million are forced to drop out from school and abandon their childhood. For Sri Satyarthi, these are not only numbers but faces.  He narrated few of his difficult experiences when extending help to the children was not easy. The bruised, traumatized children who went through hell of an experience, like taking up a gun or being sex-slave, asked the basic question when rescued, \"Am I still a child?\"Sri Satyarthi became somewhat emotional to ask what are the faults of these children to have this suffering thrust upon them. Is it because of poverty as some people say? Came his thundering pronouncement. No child has ever created poverty, no child has created war, no child has created untruth. It is hypocrisy. We adults create all these and put the onus on the children. And he had data and arguments both on his side. In India, there are 6 Cr. Child labour. That means there are 6 Cr. jobs available. At the same time, in India, 6.5 Cr. adults are jobless. Study shows that most of these jobless adults are parents or elder brother of this working child. Do we not see a correlation or a solution in it? World-wide due to economic slow-down or otherwise, 200+ million adults are jobless while 215 million children are at job. The extrapolation seems to work there too.Sri Satyarthi told how he was first moved as a toddler, when a fellow student had to drop out from school. Later when he wanted to do something for the deprived childhood, he was advised to start an orphanage. But he wanted to go to the root of the problem and started fighting for the child right. He started various activities, awareness program in national and international stage that brought a great change in the way Government and Industries started looking at child labour. About being at IIT Kharagpur, he said that he feels at home to be in an engineering college. He was happy to know that IIT Kharagpur houses the brightest and he was told that it is one of the most beautiful campus. He wished that the institute also hosts the most beautiful hearts; hearts that feel for the children as each of us was once a child and should not let the child in us - the pure, the innocent, die."},{"Headlines":"Solar power-driven portable cold storage to prevent food wastage","Description":"In a pioneering step aimed at zero food wastage, a group of Indian engineers have designed a solar powered, portable micro cold storage system for small farmers that will help them store agricultural produce at low temperatures in areas with poor or no access to electricity.Put together at Technology Entrepreneurship Park (STEP) of the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur), the energy efficient cold storage units run on solar power harnessed through 2.5 KW - 3.5 KW panels and can be customised according to the crops.\"The thermal storage concept does not depend on grid electricity and after a two-year break-even, can generate over 40 percent increase in profits. Normally cold storages work on electricity and require battery back ups. But with our innovation, the solar powered ones does away with need for battery backups and eliminates running cost,\" Vivek Pandey, one of the engineers from IIT-Kgp, told IANS.In India alone, 10 million tonnes of cold storage capacity is required to prevent the over 30 percent wastage of perishable produce. Indian food supply chain lacks storage infrastructure by 60 percent.Pandey explained by using the novel storage unit, farmers will have the flexibility to store their produce and sell it in the market when prices increase.\"This will reduce wastage sustainably, increase margins for farmers, and further stabilize the supply chain, while preventing gluts. Moreover, the normal units cost four times the solar powered ones designed by us. We have filed for four different patents for the technology,\" he said.At a dimension of eight foot by eight foot by eight foot (for five metric tonne unit) and varying storage capacity of 3.5, 5 and 10 metric tonnes, the units can be hauled onto small trucks and cargo vans for transport.They are functional for storing horticultural and root crops at the moment, Pandey said.Pandey and Rahul Sharma from IIFT, Kolkata won the top prize for this innovation (Rs.10 lakh) in the national university competition DuPont: The Power of Shunya.Having sold three to four units in Karnataka already, under the aegis of Ecofrost Technologies, the group is focusing on standardisation of the units so that prices can be lowered.

The award was conferred at the award function at IIM Ahmedabad on 29th March 2014 where Dr. R.A. Mashelkar gave away the awards.The existing, commercial rapid diagnostic devices/kits are severely limited in their functionality, scope (chiefly available for malaria detection and pregnancy tests), and out-reach.  Taking cognizance of the present dismal state of point-of-care diagnostics in developing countries, like India, we have demonstrated the ingenious fabrication, and functionality, of a novel, yet elegantly simple and inexpensive, paper-and-pencil microfluidic device for active electrical control of liquid transport.  Generally, liquids imbibe through paper substrates by the natural capillary suction of the liquid through the innumerable microscopic flow passages formed by the inherent inter-paper-fibre spaces.  In purview of this fact, the working principle of the proposed paper-and-pencil device is based on the electrically-mediated capillary flow of the test liquid through frugally designed channels on normal paper, culminating in superior controllability, enhanced repeatability and augmented throughput-rate, as compared to the presently available rapid diagnostic kits. Such electrically controlled liquid flow in the device can be suitably tuned for radically improving the present modality, scope, and reach of point-of-care diagnostics in developing countries.  To this end, we have demonstrated the efficacy of the fabricated low-cost, multiplexable paper-and-pencil device as rapid diagnostic test kits for diabetes and jaundice (chosen as case studies)."},{"Headlines":"Pijus Kundu bags Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Awards - 2014 with Technological Edge Award","Description":"Pijus Kundu (Supervisors: Prof T K Bhattacharyya and Professor Soumen Das), student of E&ECE dept, has been awarded Gandhian Young Technological Innovation (GYTI) Awards - 2014 with Technological Edge(TE) Award for his work Performance Enhancement of Microthruster using Nano-engineered MEMS Structure for Long Term Space Mission .

There would probably be only few amongst us here who were born before 15th August 1947 and fewer, if any, who participated in the freedom struggle. We, who have not lived those days, will find it a little difficult to truly feel what subjugation and bondage meant, the emotions that flowed on that eventful day more than six decades ago and the sacrifice that was made to attain it. The vivid first-hand stories of the heroic struggle that I heard from my parents, grandparents and teachers, makes my heart tremble even today. I have ever remained grateful to the people who gave this great gift of independence to us. I request you too to remember them with gratitude.  We, the inhabitants of IIT Kharagpur are in a sense fortunate.  Here memories are cast in stone so that it remains alive in our hearts and minds. We live on a land where supreme sacrifice was made, housing a temple that once symbolized the freedom movement and today represents, as we know, India�s future. My own school teacher was jailed here for several years. In school he used to tell us stories of the Hijli jail and we would hear him with wonder and disbelief. In him I had seen the greatness of a freedom fighter, who gave all  a rich household, a brilliant academic career and a lucrative profession, gifting us this freedom and yet asked for nothing, got nothing, kept himself away from public glare and always remained fearless and optimistic, brimming with confidence and self-belief. It is on the shoulders of innumerable people like him we stand today in this place that Indians look upon to redeem their pledge.  Independence gave us the freedom to shape our own destiny. On the altar of sacrifice of our countrymen, our founding fathers handed over to us this Institution to build, where the Indians of the future will be developed, who can transform the country to one where equality and prosperity go hand in hand. We at IIT Kharagpur are privileged and have been empowered by the citizens of India to do so. It is therefore our onerous responsibility to live up to their expectations. The people of this country pay for our sustenance in the hope that we shall change India and usher in a better future for them. We cannot afford to destroy the hopes and faith that they have bestowed on us. What India shall we build my friends? What sort of Indians shall we become? How shall we ensure that this gentle giant, as our country is historically known to be, is able to avoid the pitfalls of intolerance, belligerence, falsehood and timidity that challenge us today and help give its citizens, especially the illiterate, poor, oppressed and helpless, the education, empowerment, happiness and quality of life that they deserve?  How shall we become great not only in expertise and experience to make our people and the people of the world prosperous but also display qualities of fearlessness and sacrifice that will sanctify and guard our prosperity and happiness with the fence of virtue? We, the fortunate, owe our forefathers for whom we are able to celebrate this day, a great debt - to make the poorest of the poor smile, the oppressed empowered and help our fellow countrymen meet their dreams.

He had been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and was on life support system since Aug 09. Murmu was one of the most dynamic personalities of IIT-KGP Alumni Community and was one of the most lovable alum brothers of our fraternity. This is indeed a great loss for all of us. Let us join hands in bidding him a last goodbye. May his soul rest in peace. He was a social engineer, sportsman, environmentalist, philosopher and a change maker. However, he was foremost a visionary social thinker and firmly believed and advocated  one must pay back to the society. According to him, even the oxygen we breathe is not free. It is the fruit of sustained environment that our forefathers have preserved. Born in 1957, Murmu was the Deputy General Manager of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. He was an active alumnus of KGP and Pan IIT body. He was a core committee member of Pan IIT Global Conference 2010.  He was an inspirational force behind the alumni movement in TAA Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore. He raised more than 1.5 million INR for TAA Delhi & Foundation. Murmu had been a key person in availing 80G tax exemption for IIT Kharagpur Alumni Foundation.

The said newspaper article casts defamatory aspersions on Mr. Shiv Nadar, the Chairman of the Board of Governors, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The article refers to the venture being proposed by M/s. HCL Technologies Ltd. for imparting coaching to IIT aspirants.The news article is based on surmises, speculation and conjecture and makes false and baseless allegations. I may like to bring it to your attention that the posts of the Chairman, Board of Governors and also of all Board Members are in fact honorary posts. The Chairman, Board of Governors is nominated by the Visitor on the basis of his impeccable credentials both professionally and personally. The role of the Board of Governors is to give strategic direction to the institution for which the Board is convened once in every quarter. The Chairman and the Board Members do not have any role to play in the operational functioning of IIT Kharagpur.  Under the provisions of the Institute of Technologies Act, 1961, the Board of Governors is a policy-making body which does not in any manner deal with the conduct of Joint Entrance Examinations to the IITs. The article fallaciously ignores the facet that the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is in fact conducted by a representative body called the Joint Admission Board.  The Joint Admission Board comprises Directors of all IITs, Chairmen/Vice-Chairmen of Undergraduate Admission Committees (JEE)  and a representative of the MHRD as its members.  JAB acts as the supervising and policy making body for conducting the Joint Entrance Examination, which is implemented by the Joint Implementation Committee (JIC), a sub-committee of the Joint Admission Board comprising the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of JEE of each Institute. Therefore, neither the  Board of  Governors as a body, nor  any  of its members have any role to play in the conduct of the JEE and access to any JEE related confidential information including the information mentioned in your article. It is, therefore, in no way a conflict of interest for Dr. Shiv Nadar or M/s. HCL Technologies to promote coaching centres in order to encourage IIT aspirants. Moreover, this news item cast aspersions on the integrity of IIT faculty regarding setting and printing of question papers.In so far as the allegations regarding purchases from M/s. HCL Technologies are concerned, please note that it is actually the Director of each Institute of Technology who is empowered under the rules and regulations of the Institute to authorise purchases.   Further, all purchases by the Institute are made by following the CVC norms in this regard and through an open tender process.   The captioned article is therefore completely false and baseless and defamatory of Dr. Nadar, Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur and also the faculty of IITs. The callous nature of reporting is also demonstrated by the absence of any verification of the facts with any of the persons or authorities named in the article. None of the persons or authorities named in the articles were even asked for comments prior to the publication of the article. It is indeed unfortunate that a newspaper of the reputation of The Pioneer has published this article without ensuring that the facts mentioned therein are accurate.I therefore request you to publish a retraction with due apology at the earliest clarifying the correct position, failing which I would be constrained to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against the newspaper, the editor as well as the reporter for the defamatory contents of the captioned article.A separate letter in this regard is also being addressed to the Honble Chairman, the Press Council of India, requesting his intervention and needful action.This is issued with the approval of the competent authority.Thanking you,Yours sincerely,T.

The ninth edition just concluded on Sunday. Far removed from Bangalore, a National Cadet Corps (NCC) air wing cadet from West Bengal, Tippa Muniraja of No. 3 Bengal Technical (Air) Squadron, NCC of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur is living his aviation dreams by designing aircraft models, with an avowed aim that in the near future his aerofoil designs will find new wings to fly at such international air shows.A second-year, B. Tech, Aerospace Engineering student from IIT Kharagpur, Flight Cadet Muniraja was among 35 other NCC cadets who received medals of honour from West Bengal Governor, Shri MK Narayanan for individual excellence and achievements here last week in  Kolkata.\"Generally aero-modelling does not form a major part of Technical (Air) Squadron NCC activities,\" says Muniraja's Commanding Officer, Wing Commander Trilok Bandhu Gupta, an IAF Aeronautical Engineer. \"But Tippa is the brain behind resurgence in aero modelling and IIT Kharagpur, is fully supporting the endeavour with adequate funds,\" he adds.Keen to specialise in 'experimental aerodynamics', a visit to nearby IAF airbase of Kalaikunda to see fighter jets fly and chatting up with some young pilots would radically steel his resolve to further his dreams. \"Although we have gained independence but we haven't truly gained air independence (sic) as yet,\" a pilot alluding to the dependence on aircraft from foreign countries had said.Muniraja, incidentally is one of the only two aerospace engineering students in his batch who opted to join the air wing of NCC. Although IAF authorities do not come to the IIT for campus selection, yet Muniraja is motivated enough to join the Air Force. But just in case he does not make it to the IAF, he says he will be equally happy to work in any Indian aviation industry or DRDO in the field of research if need be, as long as it is for the nation. Clearly, NCC instilled values of 'nation comes first' is etched in the mind of this young aerospace engineering student who hopes to see IAF pilots fly indigenously built aircraft in future."},{"Headlines":"Prof Pallab Dasgupta  wins ISA Technomentor Award 2012","Description":"Professor Pallab Dasgupta of the Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering has won the ISA Technomentor Award from the India Semiconductor Association.

For this it is looking at solutions through food chemistry and advanced thermal operations in food processing technology. In this regard, it has closely monitored the physiological and biochemical activities associated with fruit and vegetable deterioration.The study was carried out on control of atmospheric storage along with gas and temperature other than humidity and moisture control. Using liquid nitrogen allows rapid cooling of fruits like litchi, mango, guava, banana and apple after harvest reduction. This method was faster than the conventional refrigeration system according to Prof. T K Goswami.Presence of decay test for checking the CA (Controlled Air) chamber - CA chamber is the answer to cold chain for preserved fruits and vegetables. Need for high technology in preservation of fruits and vegetables after harvest will prevent wastage. The research had been submitted to ministry of food processing. Also international investors and entrepreneurs had promising growth prospects to set up storage centres for fruits and vegetables in the country. The segment of food storage units was a key allied industry for the progress of food processing, which would help to reduce the massive wastage. It would also enhance the quality of the products and generate employment apart from enhancing the remuneration for farmers.The size of the food industry in India is valued at Rs 8,60,000 crore. Much of the industry is focussed on primarily processed foods. Current estimates indicate that level of processing constitutes fruits and vegetables - mere 2 per cent, poultry - 6 per cent, milk -35 per cent and the remaining were grains and cereals. The country痴 post-harvest losses continue to be the same as what was a decade ago.However, that there was serious lack of suitable infrastructure, quality control and testing labs, insufficient supply chain vis-a-vis involvement of middlemen, poor process ability of variety of farm products, seasonality and sensitivity of raw materials, high inventory carrying cost, high tax and increased packing rates, besides abysmal infrastructure of cold chains. All these factors resulted in wastage across the food sector accounting to Rs 50,000 crore. Therefore investments for ensuring an efficient post-harvest with right storage systems and solutions is found wanting across states in the country. IIT-Kharagpur has carried out studies on advanced storage options for fruits and vegetables."},{"Headlines":"Dr. Sabyashachi Mishra honoured by DST","Description":"Dr. Sabyashachi Mishra, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry has been selected by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), India, for the following : (i) Ramanujan Fellowship and(ii) DST INSPIRE Faculty Award.
